A system that uses genetic algorithms to automatically evolve and optimize microservices architecture based on performance metrics and usage patterns. This is an exciting and complex project that combines several advanced concepts in software architecture, DevOps, and artificial intelligence.

The system works as follows:

1. The frontend periodically fetches the current architecture and performance metrics from the API.
2. When the user clicks "Start Evolution," it triggers the genetic algorithm to optimize the architecture based on performance metrics.
3. The genetic algorithm uses mutation (splitting or merging services) and crossover operations to generate new architectural configurations.
4. The fitness of each configuration is evaluated based on overall performance metrics.
5. The best-performing architecture is selected and implemented.
6. The process repeats, continuously optimizing the architecture over time.

Disclaimer: AWS Credentials

This project does not include or reference any AWS credentials in the codebase, configuration files, or environment variables. This is an intentional decision to avoid accidental exposure of sensitive information and to prevent any unintended charges related to AWS services such as S3 bucket usage or other billable resources.

Key Points:

No Hardcoded Credentials: At no point are AWS Access Keys or Secret Keys included in the source code.

No AWS Resources Created: The project does not make any calls to AWS APIs or attempt to create resources such as S3 buckets, EC2 instances, or any other AWS service.

Environment Variables Not Configured: Ensure that no environment-specific AWS credentials are set or used while running this project.

Recommendations:

If you intend to integrate this project with AWS services, please use environment variables or a credentials manager to securely provide AWS credentials.

Consider using the AWS SDK with temporary security tokens, IAM roles, or a secure secret management tool.

By omitting AWS credentials from this project, I aim to maintain secure coding practices and avoid unnecessary charges or misuse of resources.
